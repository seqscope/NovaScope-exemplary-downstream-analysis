# Welcome to the NovaScope Exemplary Downstream Analysis (NEDA) Documentation

## Introduction
This document serves as a guide for exemplary downstream analysis of spatial transcriptomics data generated from [NovaScope](https://github.com/seqscope/NovaScope/tree/main). The main functionalities include:

1) **[Pixel-level Analysis](./analysis/hex_idx/intro.md)**: 
   This feature enables the identification of spatial factors at a pixel-level resolution using a hexagon-indexed spatial digital gene expression matrix (SGE).

2) **[Cell Segmentation-based Analysis](./analysis/cell_idx/intro.md)**: 
    This feature facilitates the aggregation of spatial transcriptomics data at the cellular level based on histology files and supports the analysis of cell type clusters using the cell-indexed SGE.
