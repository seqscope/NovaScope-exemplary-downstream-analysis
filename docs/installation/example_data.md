# Accessing Example Datasets

We have made available three datasets associated with the NovaScope protocol to be used as input for the NovaScope Exemplary Downstream Analysis (NEDA). 

## Data Overview 
These datasets are accessible under a single DOI at [this link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10841778). Created using [NovaScope](https://github.com/seqscope/NovaScope/tree/main), these datasets originate from FASTQ files derived from the same liver tissue section of an 8-week-old C57BL/6 wild-type male mouse. Below, you will find a brief overview along with instructions on how to download the datasets.

### Minimal Test Run Dataset
The minimal test run  dataset was created using a subset of a liver section with a relatively shallow depth in the 2nd sequencing. This dataset is intended for preliminary testing of [NEDA](https://seqscope.github.io/NovaScope-exemplary-downstream-analysis/), primarily for validating NEDA scripts' functionality. It is not designed to yield biological insights.

### Shallow Liver Section Dataset
This dataset was generated by a Seq-Scope dataset for a tissue section, characterized by a relatively shallow 2nd-Seq library sequencing depth (i.e., approximately 163 million paired-end reads). The dataset from FASTQ files with such depth should be sufficient to investigate major cell types alongside marker genes pertaining to liver cell diversity and perform basic pixel-level decoding of the spatial transcriptome. This dataset comes along with a set of aligned Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histology images. 

### Deep Liver Section Dataset
The initial examination of the [shallow dataset](#shallow-liver-section-sge-dataset) was encouraging, prompting a more extensive sequencing of the sample tissue to fully saturate the library (i.e., approximately 2.61 billion paired-end reads). The deep dataset was produced using all pairs of 2nd-seq FASTQ files. While datasets with shallower sequencing depths offer valuable insights, deep sequencing allows for a more thorough exploration of the data. This dataset also includes a set of aligned H&E stained histology images.
